/**(The Rectangle class) Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2, 
 * design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains:
* Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height 
* of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both width and height.
* A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
* A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height.
* A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
* A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.
* Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. 
* Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objectsâ€”one with width 4 and 
* height 40 and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9. Display the width, height, 
* area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.
